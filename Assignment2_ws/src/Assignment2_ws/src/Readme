circle.py

In this code, first parameters such as speed, angular speed and distance were defined. Linear velocity in the x direction and angular velocity in the z direction are taken as inputs here, whereas, all other velocities are zero. Now, the current time was set to compute distance. When the traversed distance is less than the pre-set distance, the turtle will have a velocity and start moving and a circle will be traced as shown in the clip.

In this code, first parameters such as speed, angular speed and distance were defined where distance was equal to the side of the square. Linear velocity in the x direction and angular velocity in the z direction are taken as inputs here, whereas, all other velocities are zero. Now, the current time was set to compute distance. When the traversed distance is less than the pre-set distance, the turtle will have a velocity and start moving and a circle will be traced as shown in the clip.
